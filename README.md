# r_in_progress

In this repo I'll be uploading some new things that I learn using R for my CS degree

## Intro

My repo is divided in 2 parts; "Laboratorios" and other folders. In "Laboratorios" I'll be uploading some long and diverse exercises about the topics from the other folders (folder 1, f2, ...). In this other folders will be quick exercises (as they are called like that) from the selected topic
